Sometimes, you might want to attach arbitrary information to routes likeï¼š transition names, or roles to control who can access the route, etc. This can be achieved through the `meta` property which accepts an object of properties and can be accessed on the route location and navigation guards. You can define `meta` properties like this:

```js
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/posts',
    component: PostsLayout,
    children: [
      {
        path: 'new',
        component: PostsNew,
        // only authenticated users can create posts
        meta: { requiresAuth: true },
      },
      {
        path: ':id',
        component: PostsDetail,
        // anybody can read a post
        meta: { requiresAuth: false },
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

So how do we access this `meta` field?

<!-- TODO: the explanation about route records should be explained before and things should be moved here -->

First, each route object in the `routes` configuration is called a **route record**. Route records may be nested. Therefore when a route is matched, it can potentially match more than one route record.

For example, with the above route config, the URL `/posts/new` will match both the parent route record (`path: '/posts'`) and the child route record (`path: 'new'`).

All route records matched by a route are exposed on the `$route` object (and also route objects in navigation guards) as the `$route.matched` Array. We could loop through that array to check all `meta` fields, but Vue Router also provides you a `$route.meta` that is a non-recursive merge of **all `meta`** fields from parent to child. Meaning you can simply write

```js
router.beforeEach((to, from) => {
  // instead of having to check every route record with
  // to.matched.some(record => record.meta.requiresAuth)
  if (to.meta.requiresAuth && !auth.isLoggedIn()) {
    // this route requires auth, check if logged in
    // if not, redirect to login page.
    return {
      path: '/login',
      // save the location we were at to come back later
      query: { redirect: to.fullPath },
    }
  }
})
```

## TypeScript

It is possible to type the meta field by extending the `RouteMeta` interface from `vue-router`:

```ts
// This can be directly added to any of your `.ts` files like `router.ts`
// It can also be added to a `.d.ts` file. Make sure it's included in
// project's tsconfig.json "files"
import 'vue-router'

// To ensure it is treated as a module, add at least one `export` statement
export {}

declare module 'vue-router' {
  interface RouteMeta {
    // is optional
    isAdmin?: boolean
    // must be declared by every route
    requiresAuth: boolean
  }
}
```
